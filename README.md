# Hypno's Lullaby: Full Restored

A project spearheaded by [Nebula_Zorua](https://twitter.com/nebula_zorua) to restore the Hypno's Lullaby mod

Due to a lack of motivation, however, the mod died and I don't want to keep it anymore, so I'm throwing it out here

Credits:

- The original Lullaby Team - The original mod (so most of the assets, etc). You can find them all individually in the credits menu ingame.

It was a fun ride, but this is where I sign off
